Text:

If you have an unlabeled <...> in a paragraph, following C<...>
etc. in the paragraph are untranslated.

Missing: 
=note
=startpic 
=endpic
=pic

Driver:

The following program will be indented wrongly:

        sub foo {

                bar;

        }

because it is three separate paragraphs.

The F<...>-parsing code should be in the driver, not in Text.


C<foo\>bar> is being rendered as 'foo\>bar' instead of as 'foo>bar'.
There is deep confusion concering the paragraph in chap3 that begins
"Now we can memoize C<date_to_string>."
